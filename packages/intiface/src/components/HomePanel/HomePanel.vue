        <p><a href="https://intiface.com/central">Intiface Central</a> is now the new hub
        application for Buttplug. It contains all of the functionality of Intiface Desktop, while
        also running on Android/iOS, and is based on a platform I don't hate working on (flutter
        instead of electron/node).</p>
        <p>Intiface Central is available for download at <a
        href="https://intiface.com/central">https://intiface.com/central</a>.</p>
        <p>You will need to download and install the new application, and manually uninstall
        Intiface Desktop.</p>
        <p><b>MOST PROGRAMS THAT WORK WITH INTIFACE DESKTOP SHOULD ALSO WORK WITH INTIFACE
        CENTRAL.</b> If they don't, contact the original author of the program or let us know via
        the methods listed below.</p>
        <p>If you need help with the upgrade, you can contact support via <a
        href="https://twitter.com/buttplugio">Twitter</a>, <a
        href="https://buttplug.zone/buttplugio">Mastodon</a>, or <a
        href="https://discord.buttplug.io">Discord</a>. If these links do not work in the future,
        check the <a href="https://buttplug.io">Buttplug.io website</a> for up-to-date contact
        instructions.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Intiface Desktop is now discontinued. You can continue to use Desktop (and may still need
        to for some older programs that used setups specific to Intiface Desktop), but it will no
        longer receive device configuration or engine updates. Due to the way electron updates work,
        I cannot have Desktop update automatically to Intiface Central, so this is the best way I
        have to get the message out to users.</p>         
        <p>In the future, update features for Desktop may break due to missing URLs. <u
        style="color:#FF0000;">CHECK FOR UPDATES ON STARTUP IS NOW DISABLED AND WILL NOT
        FUNCTION</u>, but you can continue to try updating via the settings panel if it brings you
        some sort of emotional fulfillment. However, as long as the system still has an
        intiface-cli-rs executable in the right place, Desktop should continue to install correctly
        and function.</p>
        <p>Good night, sweet application. You basically did your job ok enough. I guess.</p>
